TanmayAI is a machine learning model that classifies human emotions from text.
It uses a Naive Bayes classifier with Bag-of-Words vectorization to identify emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, and more from textual input.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation

üöÄ Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook TanmayAI.ipynb


Make sure your dataset file train.txt is in the same folder.
It should have text data and corresponding emotion labels (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.).

Run all the cells in the notebook to:

Load and clean the dataset

Vectorize the text using CountVectorizer

Train the Naive Bayes model
